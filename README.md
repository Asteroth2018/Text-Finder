# Text-Finder
A small python program that scans/finds specific sentences/words in text files

You can run it in terminal (I only tested on linux)

Give it a word and path to your text files and it will look for the word in all of them

It can scan '.html', '.htm', '.txt', '.css', '.js', '.py', '.md', '.xml', '.json', '.log', '.csv', '.sh', '.yml', '.yaml', '.conf', '.pdf' and more!!!

Requirements:
urllib3
PyPDF2
colorama
pyfiglet
termcolor

You can install them with pip
